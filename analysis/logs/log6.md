# MK-Learner Log Entry #6

### Rose:
- Tuesday's discussion on using github Desktop/ VS Code was insightful
  - Learnt more about .DS_Store files created by Macs, and used a nice one-liner to get rid of them
    - `find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch -f`
  - Ran a simple `git merge` and created a pull request to [pull changes from a parent fork](https://github.com/meghavarshini/DSF-template-compendium/pull/1)
  - Fruitful discussion on reproduciblilty. I got a chance to show off my experiences with Twitter API for automating the processing of Twitter data 

- Git Demo and tutorial
  - Solid demo for how changes are synced using Github Desktop/VS Code github integration
  - I want to try CyVerse CLI + Github to run code before Monday's tutorial on containers
  
### Bud: 
- I still am dependent on the Github Web for pull requests and merges- I wonder if this can be done from the terminal

### Thorn:
