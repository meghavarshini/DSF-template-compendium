# MK-Learner Log Entry #3

### Rose:
- Why should we make multiple, small commmits, over large commits?
  - reduces chances of curruption or loss of large changes
  -  A very fruitful discussion on why version control is better than using binary files that need to be re-saved with a new name each time

### Bud: 
- What happens when we save binary files to Github- binary files will get replaced and can't be recovered from previous commits
- Proprietary software has it's own format- so our data must be robust to such changes. I need to learn more about international standards for data
- "Making data future-proof"
- Finding ways to assess data integrity
- Data Life Cycle- I am keen to implement this!

### Thorn: 
- How to work with version control when our collaborators can't learn Git
- JSON files- need to learn more about them
- Strategies for searching data- I don't have very many
- Find ways to search within speech files
